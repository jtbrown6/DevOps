## AWS Learning Paths

### AWS Cloud Engineer - Mid Level
In this learning path, you’ll improve your skills so that you’re ready to transition into an intermediate AWS cloud engineering role. You’ll start by learning how to migrate existing workloads into the AWS ecosystem, followed by hands-on deep dives into CloudFormation and ECS, two key services that you’ll use often as an engineer. Next, you’ll explore a number of automation strategies using Lambda, and finally, you’ll prepare for a professional level DevOps engineering certification. When you finish, you’ll be well qualified for an intermediate level engineering job working with AWS.

### Junior AWS Cloud Engineer - Entry Level
In this entry-level learning path, you’ll prepare for your first role as an AWS cloud engineer. You’ll begin with by learning Linux, the operating system that powers much of the cloud. Next, you’ll be introduced to core concepts of cloud computing and gain a better understanding of the purpose of platforms like AWS, before diving into Python, a programming language that will help you work with the different services you’ll interact with as a cloud engineer. Finally, you’ll learn AWS in-depth, preparing for two associate-level certifications that will help you earn your first job working in the cloud. As an entry-level AWS cloud engineer, you’ll help implement basic features, maintain existing infrastructure, and assisting in managing your organization’s cloud infrastructure. Your job responsibilities may include writing code to join various parts of your organization’s systems, implementing solutions that have been designed by senior engineers, and working with various departments within the company, both technical and non-technical, to maintain a reliable, scalable system. This is an entry-level learning path, so all you need is a basic understanding of how to use a personal computer, and an interest in developing new skills. Prior experience in a technical role is helpful but not required.
